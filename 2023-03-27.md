## Quacker Board
* I2C "plug" would be a great feature
    * No need to solder sensors, just connect and go
* part of roadmap: create a CDP driver -> attach a LoRa hat
* Make the CDP use multi-core instead of single core
    * One core can manage the radio
    * The other core can manage the data process
    * Might make the process more efficient

## DMS-Lite
* links are broken in wiki

## Merging
* What should the process be to merge into master branch?


## Talking Points for Today
* Library Dependencies
    * Rayvn working on a script to get the libraries needed to run CDP
    * Can we just use this: [ClusterDuck Automator](https://github.com/dmandala/ClusterDuck_Automator_for_Linux)
* Amir's bug find on transmission
    * "The duck was going immediately to sleep after sending a message, preventing the Radio from completing the transmit"
* Update Platform IO listing?
* Jeff's Maple Syrup Farm
