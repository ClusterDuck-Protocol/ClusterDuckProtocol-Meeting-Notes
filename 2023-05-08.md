* Beta Testers
  * Things to test for CDP:
    1. Software/ Firmware
      * Currently using Travis, DCO, WIP
      * Unit tests can be used for software but cannot check for hardware or network issues
    2. Hardware
      * Are the boards' pins correctly defined? 
      * Does the protocol compile successfully on the board?
    3. Network 
      * at the moment, cannot be automated 
      * needs personnel to deployment and test to see if it works
      * maybe in the distant future can be simulated?  
  * New Features
    * Each new feature needs to come with like a checklist to test if feature works
    * What version is being tested?
    * How are you testing it?
    * How can we reproduce similar results?

* v3 Issues
  * Platformio
