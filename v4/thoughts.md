* Acking
  - Should be sparse
  - Must be bundle-able (one ack for many messages)
  - There is already a topic for acks, but there needs to be a format
  - Should developers have access to setting messages as ackable?
* Displays
  - Should have a uniform API for printing to display
  - Curtail the ability to customize the display?
  - Display API should ideally hide SPI vs I2C interface details
* Docs
  - Really need updated step-by-step instructions for getting started
  - Notes on pit-falls and limitations of the CDP?
  - Develop ready-made projects people can do alongside the examples? (good for schools)
  - Version the docs, or tell everybody to use the latest?
