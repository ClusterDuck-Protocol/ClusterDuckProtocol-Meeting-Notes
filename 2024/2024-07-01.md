# Hacktoberfest!
* October is 4 months away!
* How can we use that opportunity to bring more awareness to CDP? 
  * hackathon ideas? events?

## PR and Issues
* [Duck Display](https://github.com/ClusterDuck-Protocol/ClusterDuck-Protocol/issues/416) is resolved!
* [Github File Organization](https://github.com/ClusterDuck-Protocol/ClusterDuck-Protocol/pull/418)
  * The build system is throwing an error about `#include <esp_int_wdt.h>`
  * Read the comment thread
  * We might need to update the build system to use older version of esp_int

## Display
* The default display for CDP is U8g2
* Brenton wants to use Arduino's display library
  * more intuitive and better functionality
* Brenton will build a "QuackPack" (a plugin) for the Arduino's display library

## Quack Packs
* This is a new concept for CDP, think of plug-ins for CDP
  * We have the core comms network and the QuackPacks will be features that people can plug in
* The architecture for CDP will change
* Need to test out this concept
  * Can use the Display feature Brenton will build 
  * Can use Ravyn's public chat but that requires a bit more work since it needs to interact with the radio protocol
