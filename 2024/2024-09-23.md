## CDP Architecture
* [DuckRadio.cpp](https://github.com/ClusterDuck-Protocol/ClusterDuck-Protocol/blob/master/src/DuckRadio.cpp)
  * this file is used to create a LoRa Radio instance that the Ducks can use
  * currently DuckRadio is implemented as a singleton 
    * restricts CDP to only LoRa Radio
  * if implemented as a subclassing or templating, we can switch out radio protocols 
* [DuckDisplay.cpp](https://github.com/ClusterDuck-Protocol/ClusterDuck-Protocol/blob/master/src/DuckDisplay.cpp)
  * DuckDisplay is also a singleton
    * Might change depending on which board is used
    * if implemented as a subclassing or templating, we can switch out Display code that works with specific boards

## OWL
* working on deploying ML on the edge
  * deploy a ML algo to detect [three-wattled bellbirds](https://ebird.org/species/thwbel) in forests and relay that detection in the mesh network
* Researching the Nano BLE as the device to use
* Other devices good for ML
  * [Coral](https://coral.ai/products/)
  * [Portenta](https://store.arduino.cc/products/portenta-h7)
