## Possible Use Cases for CDP
* We discussed possbile use cases for CDP
* GPS Tracker
  * Taraqur will have a PapaDuck, MamaDuck and hotspot and bike around NYC
  * Visualize the data and do simple anaylsis
* Temperature Station
    * Trevor will deploy temperature, pressure, humidity in his backyard
* Wildlife tracking?
    * research purposes
        * shark tracking
            * definitely need waterproof enclosures
        * elephant migratory paths

## Research Papers
* Read [Radio Fingerprinting for Anomaly Detection](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2023.01.021)
    * [Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JvqxXeK31j24Xy_6STffAflozE0EE6lzFmLnSPnjCMk/edit#heading=h.x074ga10xk7g)
    * Executive Summary:
        * Adversaries can disguise themselves as part of the LoRa network
          * Can flood network, DoS attack, etc,
        * Use radio fingerprinting to ID devices that should be in network
            * radio fingerprinting: each radio hardware has an imperfection that can be used as a unique identifier for that device
        * Collect radio fingerprints of LoRa network
        * Use ML and federate learning to detect malicious activity
* CDP does not have any security measures
  * Need to implement basic security

## PRs and Issues
* the AXP library not working properly with Tbeam sx1262 chip
  * Issue was created
  * Brenton will work on it
* Sending double messages
    * We are trying to send a gps packet after a health packet
    * the Mamaduck shows that both messages are sent successfully
    * the PapaDuck, however, is only processing the first message it gets and doesn't process the second one
        * added a delay (tried 1 sec, 2, and 5) between messages and still nothing happens
