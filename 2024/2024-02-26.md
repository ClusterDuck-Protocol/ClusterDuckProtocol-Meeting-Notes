* Moved the location for CDP town hall notes to CDP org

## CDP Technical Debt
* CDP over the years collected a lot of technical debt
  * There are warnings that we ignored that we shouldn't
  * Features were added that benefitted niche use cases but not CDP core tech
  * CDP do not have resources to support EVERY board
    * Let's support 3-4 boards first and be REALLY good with them
* Need to create unit tests
* Need to create guidelines for contributors
* Need to create guidelines for maintainers
* Amir is spearheading relieving the debt in https://github.com/ClusterDuck-Protocol/ClusterDuck-Protocol/tree/347_cdp_refactor_and_build_fixes
