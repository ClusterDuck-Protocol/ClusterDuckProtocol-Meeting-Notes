## 2024 Vision
* Who the Duck are We?
    * "Connect the people, places, and things you care about the most"
* Build basic core protocol that anyone can upload and get Ducks working
* Rebuild the CDP
    * we were adding features that might not have been useful for the core purpose of CDP
    * Create a basic comm protocol and remove unnecessary features (or have them as variants in other repos)
        * Understand what is happening under the hood
        * Create a list of necessary features
        * Develop those features in a modular way
            * ex: if I want to switch radio protocol from LoRa to VHF, I can just swap the LoRa file with a VHF file and it will work
        * Build variants for other use cases such as first responders, sensor networks, etc
* Q1 GOALS:
    * Get CDP running via PlatformIO
    * Understand what is under the hood of CDP
    * Create a list of necessary features for CDP
        * Create a roadmap of these features

## IDE Agnostic
* Zeroing in on PlatformIO
    * Brenton and co will give an intro on PlatformIO next Monday
    * Work on Documentation for PlatformIO and tutorials
* even though we are switching to PlatformIO, Ardunio should still be supported (maybe by contributors)

## Pull Requests / Issues
* Rv T submitted a PR for library dependency. Taraqur will review
* Heltec v3 needs to be supported
    * PlatformIO works
    * does not work in Arduino

## Paper Discussion
* Another cycle of papers are in #general for voting
* Next meet is on February 1, 2024
