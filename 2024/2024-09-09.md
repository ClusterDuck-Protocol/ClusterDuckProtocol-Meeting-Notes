## On-Going Projects
* GPS Bike
    * Taraqur cannot get a GPS lock in NYC
    * purchased a better GPS antenna (Brenton's recommendation)

## Research Paper
* Design and Implementation of a LoRa-Based Water Quality Monitoring System
    * Easy paper to read
    * Deployed waterproof sensors with LoRa to monitor water quality
    * some parameters for water quality: Conductivity, Oxygen, TDS, Turbidity, Temperature, BOD, COD, pH, Heavy metals
* CDP should submit use cases in academia papers
* What use cases can we think about?

## Possible Use Case
* In the Himalayas in Nepal, there are tea houses on the mountains. To get supplies, one must go down shop for the supplies, bring it back up
* With CDP, the tea house can send supplies needed in the tea house to save time
* Talk to Pratik to see if this can be turned into a project and Tian can contribute code to develop it
