## What is the best way to manage libraries and dependencies?
* GOAL: have a single source of truth for library versions and compatibility
* Options: using submodules, Raven's Python automation script, or manually copying libraries
* currently using submodules with source files
    * folder with libraries and versions
    * manualy sourcing all the modules
    * problems
* automator script
    * downloads the necessary libraries and installs them in the correct places
    * some are git repos, some are zips from arduino IDE
    * ESP Async platformio
        * possible ESP Async to use?: https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/zeed/ESP%20Async%20WebServer 
    * adds another dependency: need Python in machine
* json file needed with all repos and tags of version

## Issues and Pull Requests
* Issue#305 https://github.com/Call-for-Code/ClusterDuck-Protocol/issues/305 
    * cubecell 
        * more battery efficient and cost efficient
* current PRs will be tested locally and merged to master

## Board Support
* definitions in code
    * updating pin definitions
    * putting preprocessor guards
* what boards are being supported or will be? 
    * cubecell is cheaper and power efficient than heltecs different boards
* DO NOT mix different radio chips in the network (SX126x vs SX1276)
    * will not be compatible atm
    * work on testing and supporting these boards in the future

## Action Items
* Timo: Update pull request template to include testing instructions and branch information.
* Timo: Merge relevant pull requests, test, and update master branch.
* Ravyn: Continue working on Python script for library management.
* Brenton: Investigate updating CDP entry on PlatformIO.
* Community: Update CDP to support CubeCell and Heltec V3 boards.
