## Corruption in Packets
* CRC Logic
  * Only meant to compute the data portion of packet
  * Works majority of the time but is not resilient to every corruption
* Maybe the corruption occurs when a relay Duck creates a copy of the message
* What is the ratio between corruption and not corruption?
## Acking
  * Premise of 2-way communication
  * End-to-end
  * Commands to update network
    * Remote commands/flag switching
  * Got a lot of “Acks not Received”

## Reserve Topics
* Use portion of data section for acking (pre-buffer)
* Expand the reserved packet for more features for internal uses

## Fresnel Zone

## New Heltec 
* V3 https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3/ 
* More power efficient
* Uses Semtec SX1262 LoRa node chip
  * Instead of LoRa node chip SX1276/SX1278

## How do you integrate CDP into your own application?
* Provide tutorial for this scenario

## PapaDuck should be more beefer, more RAM, more possibility to do computations, ML on the edge

## Other LoRa Open Source Projects 
* [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/)
  * Open source LoRaWAN server
  * Connect chirpstack to Influx db
