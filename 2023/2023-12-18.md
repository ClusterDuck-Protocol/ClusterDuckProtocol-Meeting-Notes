## Ducks Underwater 
* Can we deploy Ducks underwater?
* student from CalPoly working on underwater modems 

## IDE Agnostic
* PlatformIO might be the way
    * this should be primary IDE for CDP
    * solves the library order and version problems of the Arduino IDE
* Work on Documentation for PlatformIO and tutorials

## Pull Requests / Issues
* Heltec v3 needs to be supported
    * PlatformIO works
    * does not work in Arduino
* Library Dependencies
    * a single script to install all libraries needed in examples
    * one script for basic Ducks and tutorial for the rest
    * two scripts: one for basic and one for all libraries

## Paper Discussion
* Part II for LoRaX this Thursday at 10 AM EST  

## Thoughts
* Can we get a more robust build farm and continuous integration process for CDP as we are developing further variants?
    * If someone were to try a new board (Heltec version 4 or whatever) and someone integrated it, and it works, they can upload that to the build farm to keep the community up to date on latest hardware support
