* frequency is important
    * how many messages are sent at a time
    * duck needs some time to process packets

* error rate was high
    * BF was using srand() instead of rand()
        * using time(NULL) as a random seed
            * always start at same value
    * AMIR -> possible solution use a simple map
    * BF is extremely scalable
        * low-memory footprint

* PapaDuck receives same messages after it rejects that message.
    * PapaDuck needs a lot of memory

* MamaDucks need powerful CPU

* Amir messing around with [LoRa E5 Dev Board](https://www.seeedstudio.com/LoRa-E5-Dev-Kit-p-4868.html)

Brenton's ClusterDuck Network
* 12 total devices
    * Heltecs used as relays

* CDP needs like a minimum systems requirements

* Using message counter to track fugitive messages

SDR for CDP
* SDR are used to communicate between different radio frequencies
    * software is used to "turn a knob" to communicate with a specific frequency
* [HackRFOne](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/)
    * transreceiver
* using Ubuntu and Docker coupled with GNU radio to operate the SDR

* some AI/ML applications can be applied in the future

## CDP v4

* [Thoughts on CDPv4](https://github.com/Project-Owl/ClusterDuckProtocol-Meeting-Notes/blob/main/v4/thoughts.md)

## Brenton's Research
* mean data rates (bits per sec) between uniform and exponential distributions in packet
    * Conclusion: "This could be validation that having mamaducks as dedicated relays is able to weather the load of a network."
* average time spent in MCU 

## Package Dependencies
* there are a lot of packages out there and we need to be clear which package and what version works with current CDP

## Bloom Filter
* current implementation does not input unique IDs to the hash table
* random function might not be random
* Amir sees almost 20% false positive rates
* Possible solutions Amir came up with
    * Increase the length of the value by adding the Duck ID to the Message ID. This gives us 12 bytes (instead of 4)
    * Hash the whole message, the data section or the whole header (28 bytes)
    * Hash the Duck ID instead of the Message ID, but use the Message ID as salt, to introduce randomness in the duck ID before hashing it
* Use an open-sourced BF: [Arash Partow](https://www.partow.net/programming/hashfunctions/index.html)

## Retry PapaDuck connect to WiFi at least 3 times
* current implementation only does 2

## Software-Defined Radio for the CDP
* students at UTD is building a SDR for the network
