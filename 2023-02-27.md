## CDP v4

* [Thoughts on CDPv4](https://github.com/Project-Owl/ClusterDuckProtocol-Meeting-Notes/blob/main/v4/thoughts.md)

## Brenton's Research
* mean data rates (bits per sec) between uniform and exponential distributions in packet
    * Conclusion: "This could be validation that having mamaducks as dedicated relays is able to weather the load of a network."
* average time spent in MCU 

## Package Dependencies
* there are a lot of packages out there and we need to be clear which package and what version works with current CDP

## Bloom Filter
* current implementation does not input unique IDs to the hash table
* random function might not be random
* Amir sees almost 20% false positive rates
* Possible solutions Amir came up with
    * Increase the length of the value by adding the Duck ID to the Message ID. This gives us 12 bytes (instead of 4)
    * Hash the whole message, the data section or the whole header (28 bytes)
    * Hash the Duck ID instead of the Message ID, but use the Message ID as salt, to introduce randomness in the duck ID before hashing it
* Use an open-sourced BF: [Arash Partow](https://www.partow.net/programming/hashfunctions/index.html)

## Retry PapaDuck connect to WiFi at least 3 times
* current implementation only does 2

## Software-Defined Radio for the CDP
* students at UTD is building a SDR for the network
